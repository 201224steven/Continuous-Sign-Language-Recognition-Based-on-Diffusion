## Notification
- This is experimental code to demonstrate the overall structure and realism of the framework. Due to the protection of the training data, the trained model will be published after the paper is received.
- The sl_network.py shows the main structure of the model. Module.DiT.py shows the main structure of DDM. 


## Prerequisites

- This project is implemented in Pytorch (>1.8). Thus please install Pytorch first.

- ctcdecode==0.4 [[parlance/ctcdecode]](https://github.com/parlance/ctcdecode)，for beam search decode.

- sclite [[kaldi-asr/kaldi]](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi), install kaldi tool to get sclite for evaluation. After installation, create a soft link toward the sclite: 
  `mkdir ./software`
  `ln -s PATH_TO_KALDI/tools/sctk-2.4.10/bin/sclite ./software/sclite`

- [SeanNaren/warp-ctc](https://github.com/SeanNaren/warp-ctc) for ctc supervision.

- You can install other required modules by conducting 
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
## Data Preparation
You can choose any one of following datasets to verify the effectiveness of CorrNet.

### PHOENIX2014 dataset
1. Download the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 Dataset [[download link]](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX/). Our experiments based on phoenix-2014.v3.tar.gz.

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it. It is suggested to make a soft link toward downloaded dataset.   
   `ln -s PATH_TO_DATASET/phoenix2014-release ./dataset/phoenix2014`

3. The original image sequence is 210x260, we resize it to 256x256 for augmentation. Run the following command to generate gloss dict and resize image sequence.     

   ```bash
   cd ./preprocess
   python dataset_preprocess.py --process-image --multiprocessing
   ```

### PHOENIX2014-T dataset
1. Download the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 Dataset [[download link]](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX-2014-T/)

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it. It is suggested to make a soft link toward downloaded dataset.   
   `ln -s PATH_TO_DATASET/PHOENIX-2014-T-release-v3/PHOENIX-2014-T ./dataset/phoenix2014-T`

3. The original image sequence is 210x260, we resize it to 256x256 for augmentation. Run the following command to generate gloss dict and resize image sequence.     

   ```bash
   cd ./preprocess
   python dataset_preprocess-T.py --process-image --multiprocessing
   ```

### CSL dataset

1. Request the CSL Dataset from this website [[download link]](https://ustc-slr.github.io/openresources/cslr-dataset-2015/index.html)

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it. It is suggested to make a soft link toward downloaded dataset.   
   `ln -s PATH_TO_DATASET ./dataset/CSL`

3. The original image sequence is 1280x720, we resize it to 256x256 for augmentation. Run the following command to generate gloss dict and resize image sequence.     

   ```bash
   cd ./preprocess
   python data_preprocess-CSL.py --process-image --multiprocessing
   ``` 

### CSL-Daily dataset

1. Request the CSL-Daily Dataset from this website [[download link]](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~zhouh156/dataset/csl-daily/)

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it. It is suggested to make a soft link toward downloaded dataset.   
   `ln -s PATH_TO_DATASET ./dataset/CSL-Daily`

3. The original image sequence is 1280x720, we resize it to 256x256 for augmentation. Run the following command to generate gloss dict and resize image sequence.     

   ```bash
   cd ./preprocess
   python data_preprocess-CSL-Daily.py --process-image --multiprocessing
   ```
